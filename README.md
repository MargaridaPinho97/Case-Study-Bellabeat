# Case Study: Bellabeat (Google Data Analytics Capstone)
Author: Margarida Pinho

## Introduction

In this case study, I played the part of a junior data analyst that performed data analysis for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The idea was to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The analysis will help guide future marketing strategies. 

Along the way, I followed the steps of the data analysis process, using what I learned in the courses from the Google Data Analytics Certificate:
